## Question 1: The Voice of Techtopia

This problem asks us to process a string by finding substrings matching the pattern "ogo...go" (where 'o' and 'g' alternate, starting and ending with 'o'). When such a substring is found, replace it with "***" and continue processing from the position after the substring.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through the string from left to right
2. At each position, check if it starts a valid "ogo...go" pattern
3. If found, add "***" to the result and skip to the end of the pattern
4. Otherwise, keep the current character and move to the next position

This efficiently identifies the target patterns while preserving other characters.

## Question 2: Dessert Dilemma in Techtopia

This problem analyzes the number of ways Toma can choose desserts with constraints:
- Toma has n coins
- The coffee shop offers k desserts

We need to consider two limiting factors:

1. With unlimited coins but k desserts, Toma could choose any subset of desserts: 2^k possible combinations (each dessert is either taken or not)

2. With n coins but unlimited dessert options, Toma could spend any amount from 0 to n coins: n+1 possibilities

Since both constraints apply simultaneously, the answer is the minimum of these two values: min(2^k, n+1)

## Question 3: Glitch in Techtopia's Text Grid

This problem involves understanding the effect of deleting adjacent pairs of characters from a string.

Key insight: If we delete positions (i, i+1) or positions (i+1, i+2), the difference in the resulting strings depends only on whether s[i] equals s[i+2].

If s[i] = s[i+2], then deleting either pair gives the same string. Otherwise, we get different strings.

To find the number of distinct strings possible, we:
1. Count positions i where s[i] = s[i+2] (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n-2)
2. Subtract this count from the total number of possible deletions (n-1)
