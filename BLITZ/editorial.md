## Question 1: The Voice of Techtopia

This problem asks us to process a string by finding substrings matching the pattern "ogo...go" (where 'o' and 'g' alternate, starting and ending with 'o'). When such a substring is found, replace it with "***" and continue processing from the position after the substring.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through the string from left to right
2. At each position, check if it starts a valid "ogo...go" pattern
3. If found, add "***" to the result and skip to the end of the pattern
4. Otherwise, keep the current character and move to the next position

This efficiently identifies the target patterns while preserving other characters.

## Question 2: Glitch in Techtopia's Text Grid

This problem involves understanding the effect of deleting adjacent pairs of characters from a string.

Key insight: If we delete positions (i, i+1) or positions (i+1, i+2), the difference in the resulting strings depends only on whether s[i] equals s[i+2].

If s[i] = s[i+2], then deleting either pair gives the same string. Otherwise, we get different strings.

To find the number of distinct strings possible, we:
1. Count positions i where s[i] = s[i+2] (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n-2)
2. Subtract this count from the total number of possible deletions (n-1)

## Question 3: Circuit Sync In Techtopia

This problem involves transforming one string s into another string t using two operations:

Flip operation: Change a single character (costs 1)
Swap operation: Swap two adjacent characters with opposite values (costs 1)

The key insight is that using the swap operation is only beneficial when there are two consecutive positions that need fixing AND they have opposite values. In all other cases, using individual flip operations is optimal.

Solution Explanation
The algorithm works as follows:

Iterate through both strings character by character
When a mismatch is found (s[i] ≠ t[i]), check if we can use a swap operation:

If the next position also has a mismatch (s[i+1] ≠ t[i+1])
AND the characters in string s at positions i and i+1 are different (s[i] ≠ s[i+1])
Then use a swap operation (increment answer by 1 and skip 2 positions)


Otherwise, use a flip operation (increment answer by 1 and move to the next position)
If characters match, simply move to the next position

This greedy approach ensures minimal operations are used to transform string s into string t.
The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the strings, as we process each character at most once.
The code properly implements this strategy by checking positions where the characters differ, applying the optimal operation at each step, and counting the total number of operations needed
